		<h2 class="content-header">The Benefits of Private Tutoring</h2>
		<div class="benefits-paragraph">
Private tutoring has numerous benefits for students who are struggling with a class as well as students who are high-performing but would like to learn more. I myself struggled in my high school math classes and improved immensely with the help of a private tutor. I raised my grades, SAT test scores, and understanding of math in a way that I could not in the classroom because of these benefits of private tutoring:

		<div class="benefits-paragraph">
<strong>-Instruction tailored to the student.</strong>
In a larger classroom, teachers have to accommodate various students' learning styles and needs (sometimes 20-30!). Even in schools with smaller classes, teachers spend time lesson planning, grading, juggling multiple classes a day, possibly coaching a sport, along with other duties of their job. One reason that private tutoring is so effective is that my job is to focus on one student and one student only. I get to know each student's learning style, strengths, and weaknesses in order to improve their skills to the best of my ability. 
		</div>
		
		<div class="benefits-paragraph">
		<strong>-Less distractions.</strong> 
		In a classroom of 10-20 students with one instructor, it is easy for students to drift off or get distracted by one of their peers, especially if the subject is not the student's favorite. Because tutoring sessions are one-on-one, students are not able to drift off as often as they might in a larger classroom setting. In addition, I use different strategies to keep students focused during tutoring sessions, such as asking questions to keep students involved and invested in their work or asking students to summarize readings page by page as we complete them during tutoring. 
		</div>
		
		<div class="benefits-paragraph">
			<strong>-Improved self-esteem.</strong>
			Even the highest performing students can lack confidence in their academic abilities. Tutoring helps boost student confidence by deeply familiarizing students with the subject at hand. Students also have a setting in which they feel safe asking questions and expressing concerns that they might not feel comfortable sharing around peers.
