		<h2 class="content-header">About Me</h2>
		<div class="paragraph">
		I am an enthusiastic, well-trained educator in the DC area with a special knack for one-on-one tutoring. I earned my bachelor's degree in English from the University of Virginia and my master's degree in English from the University of Mississippi. I was awarded a teaching fellowship while studying at the University of Mississippi and completed my degree two semesters early from my program.

		<h2 class="content-header">My Experience</h2>
		<div class="paragraph">
		I have extensive experience as an educator. My experience began with a teaching internship in college at The Village School, aiding the 6th grade English class. Also while at UVA, I was a volunteer tutor in an 11th grade English class at Charlottesville High School. In my graduate program, I was awarded a teaching fellowship and served as a teaching assistant for two years, teaching numerous college English classes. Also while completing my master's, I worked as a private tutor and have over 200 hours of experience tutoring. I have worked with a wide range of students, from high-performing students to students struggling with ADD and anxiety. I've taught and tutored American, British, and World literature.

		<h2 class="content-header">Private Tutoring</h2>
		<div class="paragraph">
		I teach both high school and college students in the DC area and I tailor tutoring sessions carefully to the student's individual needs. I customize the schedule and content of meetings according to the student's goals, such as improvement in an English class or help with a specific paper or test. I can help prep for the S.A.T., AP English Language and Composition, and AP English Literature and Composition. I arrange a meeting spot that works best for the student-in home, at a library, or at a student's school during study hall are all possible settings. I place a heavy emphasis on keeping parents up-to-date on their student's progress, providing weekly, in-depth e-mails or phone calls. I detail what we did during our tutoring session, what assignments the student is working on, areas in which the student is progressing, and areas in which the student needs more practice. Here is a testimonial from a parent of a student I tutored during my time in graduate school:

		<div class="paragraph">
		"I am so grateful for all you have done these past two years tutoring and supporting [student name] while at Ole Miss. Your dedication, academic skills, perseverance, encouragement, and enthusiasm have helped him achieve success in English class, writing, and studying."
